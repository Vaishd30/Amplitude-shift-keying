Amplitude shift keying modulation and demodulation and BER vs SNR

# Introduction
* Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a modulation technique used in digital communication systems. It involves varying the amplitude of a carrier signal to represent digital data. In ASK, the amplitude of the carrier signal is switched between two different values to represent a binary digit 0 or 1.
* The ASK modulator takes the binary input signal and a carrier signal as inputs. The carrier signal is typically a sine wave with a fixed frequency and amplitude. The modulator multiplies the carrier signal by the binary input signal to produce an amplitude-modulated signal. When the binary input signal is high (1), the amplitude of the carrier signal is increased, and when it is low (0), the amplitude of the carrier signal is decreased.
* The ASK demodulator extracts the digital data from the amplitude-modulated signal. It works by measuring the amplitude of the received signal at specific times and comparing it to a threshold value. If the amplitude is above the threshold, a binary 1 is detected; otherwise, a binary 0 is detected.
